    <h2>Experience</h2>
    
    <h4>The Elocen Group</h4>
    <h4>Summers 2016-2019</h4>
    
    <p>
      During my time working at Elocen, I performed routine clerical tasks such as mailing, copying,
      faxing, filing, and scanning, while also screening phone calls, taking messages, and routing them as needed. 
      I assisted principals in drafting and editing memos, reports, and proposals, and actively participated in proposal and bid meetings.
      I also took part in staff training and development activities that allowed me to build key skills along the way.
