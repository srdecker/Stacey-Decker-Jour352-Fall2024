        <h1>The cost of mass deportation under the Trump administration</h1>
        <h3>By Alexa Figueroa</h3>
        <p>Former President Donald Trump has publicly stated that if elected, he will conduct the largest deportation in American History by deporting an estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants residing in the U.S.</p>
        
        <P>The American Immigration Council created a report which aims to provide an estimation of what the fiscal and economic cost to the United States would be should the government deport the undocuemnted population. The report considered the expenses associated with arrest, detention, legal processing, and removalâ€”that the federal government would have to pay.</P>

        <p>The report also found that mass deportations would cause significant labor shocks across multiple key industries, with huge impacts on construction, agriculture, and the hospitality sector. They  estimate that nearly 14 percent of people employed in the construction industry are undocumented. Removing that labor would disrupt all forms of construction across the nation, from homes to businesses to basic infrastructure.</p>
