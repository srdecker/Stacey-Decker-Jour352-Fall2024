                        In 2018, The Pink Stuff was little more than a home cleaning product with a cute name. “The
                        miracle cleaning paste,” as it said on every container, was sold by just two retail chains in
                        Britain. At a factory near Birmingham, The Pink Stuff line operated for about two hours every
                        month. That was plenty.

                        company behind the product. “But nobody used it.”

                        Actually, The Pink Stuff — which is, yes, bubble-gum pink — had some fans. One of them was
                        Sophie Hinchliffe, a then-28-year-old hairdresser in Essex, about 30 miles east of London. Ms.
                        Hinchliffe had learned about The Pink Stuff on Instagram, naturally, and had started posting
                        daily videos to her then-new account, @mrshinchhome. All the videos were snippets of her nonstop
                        campaign to spiff up the home she had just moved into with her husband.

                        There was Mrs. Hinch, as she called herself, using a toothbrush to scrub the grout in her
                        bathroom. Here she was polishing her candlesticks. If it were stained, The Pink Stuff would
                        clean it, she told her small but growing audience. Don’t buy new tiles, she advised. Spend 99
                        pence and restore the old ones. She recommended other brands, too. The Pink Stuff was simply a
                        favorite.
